# Cryptography (CryptoCalc)

The main aim of this application is educational purposes only. By using this application, students/users will get knowledge of the algorithms of Cryptography and Network Security subjects and learn the different types of cryptographic algorithm's encryption and decryption. They can explore and learn the following algorithms; Symmetric, Asymmetric, Hashing, and some other algorithms in the security subject.

Symmetric Algorithms> Additive Cipher, Multiplicative Cipher, Affine Cipher, Auto Key Cipher, Play-Fair Cipher, Vigenere Cipher, Hill Cipher

Asymmetric Algorithms> Diffie Hellman Cipher, RSA Cipher

Hashing Algorithms> MD5, SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512

Other Algorithms> GCD Euclidian, Modulus, Prime, Multiplicative Inverse, Miller Rabin Inverse, Chinese Remainder, Square and Multiply
